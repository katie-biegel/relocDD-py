*************************
* RUN.INP File --- Overall run input file assuming you use the provided run script
**************************
* Declare Necessary Folder Paths
* Input File Folder
/path/to/folder/
* Data File Folder
/path/to/folder/
* Output Folder
/path/to/folder
**************************
* Switch Variables
* reloctype: Type of Relocation
* 1 for event-pair (hypoDD)
* 2 for station-pair
* 3 for double-pair
1
* fileout:  File/Terminal Ouputs Switch
* 0 for traditional run (output to file from ph2dt, read in to file in hypoDD, output all files)
* 1 for combo run (remove intermediate output to file; combine some funcitonality)
0
* makedata: Synthetic modelling switch
* 0 for real data
* 1 for trigger synthetic model building (Must then use synth.inp as well)
0
* HYPOINVERSE Switch (for synthetic tests only)
* 0 for no hypoinverse catalog (relocate from true)
* 1 for generate hypoinverse catalog (relocated from catalog)

**************************
* Noise Variables
* noiseswitch: Noise switch
* 0 for no added noise
* 1 for added noise
0
* noisediff: Noise difference switch
* 0 if 1 noise added per measurement (i.e. adding noise in hypoDD)
*        noise added to traveltime differences (dt_dt)
* 1 if 2 noise (noise difference) added per measurement (i.e. adding noise in ph2dt)
*        noise added to arrival times of P and S waves

* stdcc: Std of noise for cc measurements
0.001
* stdt: Std of noise for ct measurements
0.01
**************************
* Bootstrap Variables
* nboot: No. of bootstrap iterations

* nplot: Plot every nplot iterations in bootstrapping
